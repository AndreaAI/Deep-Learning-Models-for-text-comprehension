# Deep Learning Models for text comprehension

This repository contains information and explanation about Neural Networks and some parts of my Master Thesis "Development of Deep Learning Models for text comprehension using NLP techniques", as well as the implemented code.


## Artificial Neural Networks

### Backpropagation and gradient descendent

### Long Short term Memory Networks (LSTM)

#### Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)


## Memory Networks

### End-to-End Memory Networks (MemN2N)

### Key-Value Memory Networks (KV-MemNN)
